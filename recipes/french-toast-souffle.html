    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This French toast bake is a scrumptious casserole of bread, cream cheese, eggs, and milk.
    It tastes just like regular French toast, but it's made the night before and baked in the oven.
    It's not very sweet, so you <em>might</em> like more maple syrup with it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>10 cups white bread cubes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package low-fat cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>⅔ cup half-and-half cream</li>
        <li>½ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray; add bread cubes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth.
        Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in milk, half-and-half, maple syrup,
        and vanilla until mixture is smooth; pour over bread cubes. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to
        overnight.</li>
        <li>The next morning, remove soufflé from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for
        30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake soufflé, uncovered, in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out
        clean, about 30 minutes. Serve warm, sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.</li>
    </ol>
